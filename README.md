## About Me...


![alt text](<Formal Picture-2.jpg>)


I'm Farzaneh Noroozi, a CISBA (Computer Information Systems and Business Analytics) student currently immersed in the vibrant landscape of Washington state. My journey is defined by an insatiable curiosity for unraveling the intricacies of data and fortifying digital frontiers against emerging threats.

At the heart of my expertise lies a profound understanding of network security and data analysis. Equipped with tools like ShieldsUP&Nessus, NMAP, and WireShark, I excel in identifying and mitigating potential security breaches, safeguarding the integrity of digital ecosystems.

Yet, my journey extends far beyond the realm of cybersecurity. With a master's degree in Computer Information and Decision Management from West Texas A&M University and a diverse academic background in Agricultural Engineering from Shiraz University, I bring a unique blend of technical acumen and strategic insight to every endeavor.

For me, mastery of technical skills is just the beginning â€“ it's about leveraging them to drive meaningful change. Whether I'm exploring the nuances of financial fraud detection or immersing myself in the rich tapestry of Persian literature, each pursuit is fueled by unwavering dedication and enthusiasm.

Guided by an unyielding thirst for knowledge and a fervent desire to make a tangible impact, I transcend the label of a mere data scientist. I am a catalyst for change, a guardian of digital realms, and a relentless champion of innovation in the dynamic landscapes of cybersecurity and data science.

The WTAMU Graduate Catalog outlines the requirements of the MS-CISBA program, emphasizing four key curriculum areas. Within these, the capstone will hone in on subsets including Data Analytics, Data Mining and Management, Systems Development, and Networking and Cybersecurity. This repository serves as a platform to showcase a comprehensive portfolio and assess the strengths and weaknesses of the material covered in these courses, paving the way for continual growth and excellence.
