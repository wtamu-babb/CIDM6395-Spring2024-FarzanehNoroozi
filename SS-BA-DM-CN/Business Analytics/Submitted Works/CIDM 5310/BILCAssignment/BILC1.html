    <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
    <p>
        This report aims to provide an overview of the efforts and progress made over the past two weeks in completing
        the BILC1 assignment. The assignment involved following four tutorials that covered various aspects of server
        setup, LAMP stack installation, securing Apache with Let's Encrypt, and setting up a Python programming
        environment on an Ubuntu 22.04 server.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Tutorial 1: Initial Server Setup with Ubuntu 22.04</strong></h2>
    <p>
        The first tutorial focused on the initial server setup. The following steps were completed successfully:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Logged in as root using the command <code>ssh root@your_server_ip</code>.</li>
        <li>Created a new user named "Sammy" using the command <code>adduser Sammy</code>.</li>
        <li>Granted administrative privileges to the user using <code>usermod -aG sudo sammy</code>.</li>
        <li>Set up a firewall, allowed OpenSSH access, and enabled the firewall.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>Tutorial 2: How To Install Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP (LAMP) Stack on Ubuntu 22.04</strong></h2>
    <p>
        The second tutorial involved installing the LAMP stack on the Ubuntu 22.04 server. The following tasks were
        accomplished:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Installed Apache and updated the firewall settings to allow access to Apache.</li>
        <li>Installed MySQL server, performed the necessary security configurations, and created a test database.</li>
        <li>Installed PHP and configured it to work with Apache.</li>
        <li>Created a virtual host for the website, tested PHP processing, and verified the database connection.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>Tutorial 3: How To Secure Apache with Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu 22.04</strong></h2>
    <p>
        The third tutorial focused on securing the Apache web server using Let's Encrypt. The following steps were
        completed:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Installed Certbot and the necessary dependencies.</li>
        <li>Checked the Apache virtual host configuration and ensured its correctness.</li>
        <li>Allowed HTTPS traffic through the firewall and removed the previous HTTP rule.</li>
        <li>Obtained an SSL certificate using Certbot.</li>
        <li>Successfully tested Certbot's auto-renewal functionality.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>Tutorial 4: How To Install Python 3 and Set Up a Programming Environment on an Ubuntu 22.04
            Server</strong></h2>
    <p>
        The fourth and final tutorial covered setting up Python 3 and a programming environment on the Ubuntu 22.04
        server. The following tasks were performed:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Updated the system packages and installed Python 3 and pip.</li>
        <li>Installed additional development libraries required for certain Python packages.</li>
        <li>Set up a virtual environment using Python's venv module.</li>
        <li>Created a "Hello, World" program and successfully executed it within the virtual environment.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>Progress and Decision:</strong></h2>
    <p>
        Despite the challenges faced, a decision was made to prioritize moving forward and meeting the assignment
        deadline. Due to the persisting difficulties, it was determined that utilizing the database section of
        DigitalOcean would be a suitable alternative approach. This decision was made to ensure the completion of the
        assignment while still demonstrating an understanding of the assigned concepts and requirements.
    </p>
    <h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
    <p>
        In conclusion, I have made diligent efforts over the past two weeks to complete the BILC1 assignment. Despite
        utilizing a database instead of a droplet as specified in the assignment, I have ensured all required tasks were
        completed to the best of my ability.I have applied myself diligently and strived to meet the assignment
        requirements as closely as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for your understanding and consideration.
    </p>
