<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Employee fraud poses a significant threat to organizations worldwide, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and compromised integrity. Detecting and preventing such fraudulent activities is crucial for maintaining organizational security and trust. In response to this challenge, our project proposes the development of an Employee Fraud Detection System. This system harnesses advanced data analytics, data mining techniques, robust systems development methodologies, and cybersecurity measures to identify suspicious activities and potential instances of fraud within the organization.</p>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>The project aims to develop an employee fraud detection system using knowledge from the following categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Networking and Cybersecurity (CIDM 6356 & CIDM 6340)</li>
  <li>Data Analytics (CIDM 5310)</li>
  <li>Data Management (CIDM 6350 & CIDM 6355)</li>
  <li>System Development (CIDM 6303)</li>
</ul>
<p>The system will analyze employee behavioral data, financial transactions, and access logs to identify suspicious activities and potential instances of fraud within the organization.</p>

<h2>Data Collection and Integration</h2>
<p>The primary obstacle organizations face in combating employee fraud is the management and analysis of vast amounts of heterogeneous data. Employee activity logs, financial transactions, access control systems, and human resources databases all contain valuable information that, when integrated and analyzed effectively, can reveal patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.</p>

<h3>Motivation for Our Database Solution</h3>
<p>The motivation behind our database solution stems from the urgent need for organizations to proactively detect and mitigate employee fraud risks.</p>

<h2>Potential Benefits</h2>
<p>The implementation of our Employee Fraud Detection System offers several potential benefits to organizations:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Early Detection</li>
  <li>Actionable Insights</li>
  <li>Enhanced Security</li>
  <li>Operational Efficiency</li>
</ol>

<h2>Potential Users</h2>
<p>The Employee Fraud Detection System is designed to cater to a wide range of users within organizations, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Risk Management Professionals</li>
  <li>Financial Analysts</li>
  <li>Compliance Officers</li>
  <li>Executive Leadership</li>
</ul>

<h2>Forensic Objectives</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Perform an audit to find any potential fraud in customer returns</li>
  <li>Perform an audit to find any improper procedure violations in customer returns</li>
</ul>

<h3>Business Rules Regarding Customer Returns</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Customers may return products for a return of the funds onto their debit/credit card or receive a gift card.</li>
  <li>For all returns, Employees shall manually record the customers 'name, street address, city, state, and phone number into the return POS software.</li>
  <li>If a receipt is present, the employee scans the receipt which causes the computer to record the return date and return price amount automatically.</li>
  <li>If a receipt is not present, the employee shall issue a gift card for store credit and shall not return funds on a debit/credit card.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Data Analytics & System Development</h2>
<p>The integrity of the database file, myDB.db, was meticulously verified using the SHA256 hash algorithm.</p>

<h2>Networking and Cybersecurity Measures</h2>
<p>To ensure the security and integrity of our Employee Fraud Detection System, we could implement the following networking and cybersecurity measures:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Secure Data Transmission Protocols</li>
  <li>Encryption Methods</li>
  <li>Access Control Mechanisms</li>
  <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</li>
  <li>Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)</li>
  <li>Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing</li>
  <li>Data Masking and Anonymization</li>
  <li>Secure Backup and Disaster Recovery</li>
</ul>
