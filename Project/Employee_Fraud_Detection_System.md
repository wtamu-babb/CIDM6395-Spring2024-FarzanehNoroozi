    <title>Employee Fraud Detection System</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Employee fraud poses a significant threat to organizations worldwide, leading to financial losses, reputational damage, and compromised integrity. Detecting and preventing such fraudulent activities is crucial for maintaining organizational security and trust. In response to this challenge, our project proposes the development of an Employee Fraud Detection System. This system harnesses advanced data analytics, data mining techniques, robust systems development methodologies, and cybersecurity measures to identify suspicious activities and potential instances of fraud within the organization.</p>

    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>The project aims to develop an employee fraud detection system using Knowledge from what I learned in the following categories:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Networking and Cybersecurity(CIDM 6356 & CIDM 6340)</li>
        <li>Data Analytics (CIDM 5310)</li>
        <li>Data Management (CIDM 6350 & CIDM 6355)</li>
        <li>System Development (CIDM 6303)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The system will analyze employee behavioral data, financial transactions, and access logs to identify suspicious activities and potential instances of fraud within the organization.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Integration</h2>
    <p>I got the whole idea from CIDS 6356 to detect fraud in a company. The plan involves generating synthetic data, as discussed in CIDM 6356, to simulate financial transactions, access control systems, and HR databases. Here is the <a href="link_to_code">link to the code</a> for making fake data. Since each time the result would be different Please find the database <a href="link_to_database">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Data Management</h2>
    <h3>Data Management Problems</h3>
    <p>The primary obstacle organizations face in combating employee fraud is the management and analysis of vast amounts of heterogeneous data. Employee activity logs, financial transactions, access control systems, and human resources databases all contain valuable information that, when integrated and analyzed effectively, can reveal patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior. However, the complexity and volume of this data present significant challenges in terms of collection, integration, preprocessing, and analysis.</p>
    <h3>Motivation for Our Database Solution</h3>
    <p>The motivation behind our database solution stems from the urgent need for organizations to proactively detect and mitigate employee fraud risks. Traditional methods of fraud detection often rely on manual processes and rule-based systems, which are limited in their ability to adapt to evolving fraud schemes and detect subtle anomalies. By leveraging advanced data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and robust system architectures, our solution aims to provide organizations with a proactive and scalable approach to fraud detection.</p>

    <h2>Potential Benefits</h2>
    <p>The implementation of our Employee Fraud Detection System offers several potential benefits to organizations:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Early Detection: By continuously analyzing employee behavioral data, financial transactions, and access logs, the system can identify suspicious activities at an early stage, allowing organizations to intervene before significant losses occur.</li>
        <li>Actionable Insights: Through the application of data analytics and mining techniques, the system can extract actionable insights and patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior, enabling organizations to make informed decisions and implement targeted interventions.</li>
        <li>Enhanced Security: By integrating robust networking and cybersecurity measures, the system ensures the secure transmission and storage of sensitive employee data and transaction records, safeguarding organizational integrity.</li>
        <li>Operational Efficiency: The development of user-friendly interfaces, dashboards, and reporting tools streamlines the detection and investigation process, enhancing operational efficiency and reducing response times.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Potential Users</h2>
    <p>The Employee Fraud Detection System is designed to cater to a wide range of users within organizations, including:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Risk Management Professionals: Responsible for identifying and mitigating fraud risks, risk management professionals can leverage the system to proactively detect and prevent fraudulent activities.</li>
        <li>Financial Analysts: By analyzing financial transactions and uncovering suspicious patterns, financial analysts can use the system to assess fraud risks and inform decision-making processes.</li>
        <li>Compliance Officers: Charged with ensuring regulatory compliance and adherence to internal policies, compliance officers can utilize the system to monitor employee behavior and detect compliance violations.</li>
        <li>Executive Leadership: Senior executives and board members can benefit from the system's insights and analytics to gain a comprehensive understanding of fraud risks and take appropriate strategic actions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Forensic Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Perform an audit to find any potential fraud in customer returns</li>
        <li>Perform an audit to find any improper procedure violations in customer returns. Improper procedure violations are when the employee did not follow the Company Policy Regarding Customer Returns but are not necessarily fraudulent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Business Rules Regarding Customer Returns</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Customers may return products for a return of the funds onto their debit/credit card or receive a gift card as follows.</li>
        <li>For all returns, Employees shall manually record the customers 'name, street address, city, state, and phone number into the return POS software.</li>
        <li>If a receipt is present, the employee scans the receipt which causes the computer to record the return date and return price amount automatically.</li>
        <li>If a receipt is present, the customer may choose to receive the funds as a gift card or to be returned to a credit/debit card.
            <ul>
                <li>If the customer chooses a gift card, the employee scans the gift card. The POS software records the gift card number and puts the return price onto the gift card automatically.</li>
                <li>If the customer chooses to have the funds returned to their debit/credit card, the employee swipes the debit/credit card. The computer records the debit/credit card number and expiration date and transfers the return price to the debit/credit card automatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>If the receipt is not present, the employee shall do the following:
            <ul>
                <li>Returns without receipts must be issued a gift card for store credit and shall not receive funds on a debit/credit card.</li>
                <li>Employee scans the UPC barcode on the returned item. The POS software records the return price and records todayâ€™s date as the return date.</li>
                <li>The employee scans the gift card. The POS software records the gift card number and puts the return price onto the card automatically.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
